abstract="This study explores, in the context of semi-autonomous driving, how the content of the verbalized message accompanying the car's autonomous action affects the driver's attitude and safety performance. Using a driving simulator with an auto-braking function, we tested different messages that provided advance explanation of the car's imminent autonomous action. Messages providing only ``how'' information describing actions (e.g., ``The car is braking'') led to poor driving performance, whereas ``why'' information describing reasoning for actions (e.g., ``Obstacle ahead'') was preferred by drivers and led to better driving performance. Providing both ``how and why'' resulted in the safest driving performance but increased negative feelings in drivers. These results suggest that, to increase overall safety, car makers need to attend not only to the design of autonomous actions but also to the right way to explain these actions to the drivers.",

 abstract = {As in-vehicle automation becomes increasingly prevalent and capable, there will be more opportunity for vehicle drivers to delegate control to automated systems.   as well as increased ability for automated systems to intervene to increase road safety.  With the decline in how much a driver must be engaged, two problems arise: driver disengagement and reduced ability to act when necessary; and also a likely decrease in active driving, which may reduce the engagement a driver can have for the purpose of enjoyment.  As vehicles become more intelligent, they need to work collaboratively with human drivers, in the frame of a joint-cognitive system in order to both extend and backstop human capabilities to optimize safety, comfort, and engagement.},

We show that considerable coordination and negotiation work takes place both between human and robot and between humans who are involved in a joint activity when the robot approaches. While in this scenario attention getting was no problem, the interactions posed significant problems to people who did not want the robot’s service. The unwillingness to interact with the robot was mostly communicated by withholding social signals, which means that human-robot interaction designers not only need to build in ways to respond to human social signals in a timely and appropriate manner, but also a representation of what kinds of signals could be expected in order to interpret the ostensive lack of such signals adequately.},

The drawers’ behavior varied along two variables — proactive/reactive and expressive/nonexpressive motions. The results of our study indicated that participants considered an expressive robot to be more involved and interested in the interaction. They also found that while proactive or expressive robots could dominate the interaction, proactivity might negatively affect the participants’ perception of their social status relative to that of the robot’s, while expressiveness did not. This shows the importance of utilizing expressive movements when designing robots that collaborate with human users.},
