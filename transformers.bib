abstract="This study explores, in the context of semi-autonomous driving, how the content of the verbalized message accompanying the car's autonomous action affects the driver's attitude and safety performance. Using a driving simulator with an auto-braking function, we tested different messages that provided advance explanation of the car's imminent autonomous action. Messages providing only ``how'' information describing actions (e.g., ``The car is braking'') led to poor driving performance, whereas ``why'' information describing reasoning for actions (e.g., ``Obstacle ahead'') was preferred by drivers and led to better driving performance. Providing both ``how and why'' resulted in the safest driving performance but increased negative feelings in drivers. These results suggest that, to increase overall safety, car makers need to attend not only to the design of autonomous actions but also to the right way to explain these actions to the drivers.",

 abstract = {As in-vehicle automation becomes increasingly prevalent and capable, there will be more opportunity for vehicle drivers to delegate control to automated systems.   as well as increased ability for automated systems to intervene to increase road safety.  With the decline in how much a driver must be engaged, two problems arise: driver disengagement and reduced ability to act when necessary; and also a likely decrease in active driving, which may reduce the engagement a driver can have for the purpose of enjoyment.  As vehicles become more intelligent, they need to work collaboratively with human drivers, in the frame of a joint-cognitive system in order to both extend and backstop human capabilities to optimize safety, comfort, and engagement.},

We show that considerable coordination and negotiation work takes place both between human and robot and between humans who are involved in a joint activity when the robot approaches. While in this scenario attention getting was no problem, the interactions posed significant problems to people who did not want the robot’s service. The unwillingness to interact with the robot was mostly communicated by withholding social signals, which means that human-robot interaction designers not only need to build in ways to respond to human social signals in a timely and appropriate manner, but also a representation of what kinds of signals could be expected in order to interpret the ostensive lack of such signals adequately.},

The drawers’ behavior varied along two variables — proactive/reactive and expressive/nonexpressive motions. The results of our study indicated that participants considered an expressive robot to be more involved and interested in the interaction. They also found that while proactive or expressive robots could dominate the interaction, proactivity might negatively affect the participants’ perception of their social status relative to that of the robot’s, while expressiveness did not. This shows the importance of utilizing expressive movements when designing robots that collaborate with human users.},

However, their wide usage has also been criticized as not giving good representation of how real, autonomous robots can interact. In this paper, I argue that thoughtfully designed Wizard-of-Oz control interfaces can enable robot designers to explore the interaction design space fur human robot interaction and also move them towards autonomous robot development. I provide two case studies of WoZ controlled robots and their interfaces and describe the design rationale behind them. I then provide an initial set of design considerations for future WoZ controllers as a way to improve how WoZ interactions can inform the design of autonomous behavior and move closer to fully autonomous robots.},

In each condition, a robot delivers the content for a lecture on the nutrition of carbohydrates. The robot uses identical speech and body movement while the same set of slides plays on an adjacent computer, thereby controlling for such factors as educational content, robot appearance and robot size. The experiment employs Aldebaran’s 25-degrees-of-freedom Nao as the robot and the Oculus Rift as the immersive VR system. The lecture speech and slides were obtained with permission from a Mandarin Chinese-language online course and translated into English. The setup for different delivery modes for automated remote instruction are illustrated using a robot delivering foreign language online content. These methods support the design and evaluation of robots that perform the role of lecturer.},

	abstract = {Dialog between drivers and speech-based robot vehicle interfaces can be used as an instrument to find out what drivers might be concerned, confused or curious about in driving simulator studies. Eliciting ongoing conversation with drivers about topics that go beyond navigation, control of entertainment systems, or other traditional driving related tasks is important to getting drivers to engage with the activity in an open-ended fashion. In a structured improvisational Wizard of Oz study that took place in a highly immersive driving simulator, we engaged participant drivers (N=6) in an autonomous driving course where the vehicle spoke to drivers using computer-generated natural language speech. First, using microanalyses of drivers’ responses to the car’s utterances, we identify a set of topics that are expected and treated as appropriate by the participants in our study. Second, we identify a set of topics and conversational strategies that are treated as inappropriate. Third, we show that it is just these unexpected, inappropriate utterances that eventually increase users’ trust into the system, make them more at ease, and raise the system’s acceptability as a communication partner.},

abstract="AbstractAge and experience influence driver ability to cope with transitions between automated and manual driving, especially when drivers are engaged in media use. This study evaluated three age cohorts (young/new drivers, adults, and seniors) on their performance in transitions from automated driving to manual vehicle control in a laboratory driving simulator. Drivers were given three tasks to perform during the automated driving segments: to watch a movie on a tablet, to read a story on a tablet, or to supervise the car's driving. We did not find significant differences in people's driving performance following the different tasks. We also did not find significant differences in driving performance between the people in each age group who successfully completed the study; however, the rejection rate of the senior age group was over 30% because many of the people in this age group had difficulty hearing instructions, understanding tasks, or remembering what to do. We also observed pronounced differences in typical driving behaviors between groups which designers of automated systems need to take into account.",

abstract="AbstractAutonomous vehicles represent a new class of transportation that may be qualitatively different from existing cars. Two online experiments assessed lay perceptions of moral norms and responsibility for traffic accidents involving autonomous vehicles. In Experiment 1, 120 US adults read a narrative describing a traffic incident between a pedestrian and a motorist. In different experimental conditions, the pedestrian, the motorist, or both parties were at fault. Participants assigned less responsibility to a self-driving car that was at fault than to a human driver who was at fault. Participants confronted with a self-driving car at fault allocated greater responsibility to the manufacturer and the government than participants who were confronted with a human driver at fault did. In Experiment 2, 120 US adults read a narrative describing a moral dilemma in which a human driver or a self-driving car must decide between either allowing five pedestrians to die or taking action to hit a single pedestrian in order to save the five. The “utilitarian” decision to hit the single pedestrian was considered the moral norm for both a self-driving and a human-driven car. Moreover, participants assigned the obligation of setting moral norms for self-driving cars to ethics researchers and to car manufacturers. This research reveals patterns of public perception of autonomous cars and may aid lawmakers and car manufacturers in designing such cars.",
